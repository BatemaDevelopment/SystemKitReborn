SystemKit
=========

A macOS system library in Swift based off of
[libtop](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/top/top-100.1.2/libtop.c), from
Apple's top implementation.

- For an example usage of this library, see
  [dshb](https://github.com/beltex/dshb), a macOS system monitor in Swift
- For other system related statistics in Swift for macOS, see
  [SMCKit](https://github.com/beltex/SMCKit)


### Requirements

- [Xcode 8.3.3](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
- macOS 10.9+
    - This is due to Swift

### Installation

#### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) using the following command:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install carthage

To integrate SystemKit into your Xcode project using Carhage, specify it in your Cartfile:

    github "beltex/SystemKit"

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built SystemKit.framework into your Xcode project.
Don't forget to alter your Carthage [building phase for macOS](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-os-x).
